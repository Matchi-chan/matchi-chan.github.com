I'm going to try reviewing anime again.

I don't know how to start this post, so I'll get to the chase: I was extremely excited for this anime to start airing, as a preexisting fan of the Sega Hard Girls project. I can't remember how I found out about it but I'm so glad I did. The genuinely great character designs personifying (most) Sega hardware throughout history, it's also great that the art is drawn by KEI (who drew oh I don't know, the official artwork for the Crypton Vocaloids) so I was ready to go head first into an anime about them. Of course, it's an anime for a niche audience, so it's not for everyone, but I'm a person who fits the audience exactly. I love old video game hardware and I love great personification.

So, onto the anime. It's a 3D anime made in MMD which would already put off most hardcore anime fans. However, it just so helps that I'm a fan of MMD too, so that didn't put me off one bit. It's a comedy, and most of said comedy comes from referencing Sega games or the company itself.
