title: 'Oreimo series 2 episode 1 and 2 Review'
---

I'm not one to blog airing anime, but this is an exception with how much I love Oreimo. Also, I need stuff to write on this blog. I would've written this as soon as each episode came out, but I recently fell under a really bad cold which rendered me unable to sit down and do anything. So I'll review both episodes in one now I'm a bit more well. 

Spoiler warnings.

<!--break-->

Now, if you know me, you'll know I absolutely love this anime series whose full name is Ore no Imouto ga Konnani Kawaii Wake ga Nai (俺の妹がこんなに可爱いわけがない, or as it's translated to, My Little Sister Can't Be This Cute) it's a story adapted from light novels about the relationship between a big brother and little sister and how they haven't got on at all until the story which is told starts. 

The series is also somewhat pandering to otaku because it turns out the little sister Kirino is a closet otaku who likes little sister eroge and the anime-in-an-anime Hoshikuzu Witch Meruru. (Stardust Witch Meruru) and involves Kirino going out to find the first friends she's had which are also otaku with the help of Kyousuke, her older brother.

Upon watching the first series, I really, really, enjoyed it. The mix of cute and endearing characters with a pacing that was just right along with just the right amount of episodes for it to not drag on for me made it quickly secure it's place as the anime series I care most about.

So as I think you can imagine, I was flipping my shit when a second series was announced. We'll be seeing more of glorious Kuroneko! More of Kirino being a total bitch! I've been waiting since it was announced late last year for this!

###Episode 1: My Little Sister Can't Come Back Home Again

At the start of the first episode, for some reason, we flash back to Kyousuke and Kirino as little children. This scene confirms that yes, Kirino was always a bitch. Though, Kyousuke was also not very nice towards Kirino. This scene also serves to show some credits, including the ones most important to me, character design and artwork. After this scene the first episode picks up where the 12th of the first series left off, with Kirino returning from studying in America, however she had only been there 3 months because Kyousuke pulled her back. I was surprised to see Kirino wasn't pissed at him for this. Surely that was worth some tsuntsun action.

Next scene involves Kirino returning back to school and seeing Ayase and Kanako again.

![Hilarity ensues.](https://raw.github.com/Matchi-chan/matchi-chan.github.com/master/img/posts/%5BCommie%5D%20Ore%20no%20Imouto%20ga%20Konnani%20Kawaii%20Wake%20ga%20Nai.%20-%20My%20Little%20Sister%20Can't%20Be%20This%20Cute.%20-%2001%20%5B6270E791%5D.mkv_snapshot_08.05_%5B2013.04.15_12.11.28%5D.png)

In the next scene we get to see more of Kuroneko in the game-making club we saw in the alternate end to the first series. She keeps to herself like usual and doesn't like it when Kyousuke tries to grab her attention while she's typing away on her AVIO (absolutely not a rip-off of VAIO) laptop. It's also during this time that Kyousuke seems to have thoughts of feelings for her. He then takes the chance to ask Kuroneko what she meant when she kissed him on the cheek, and commence cute blushing.

Then, Sena seems to know nothing about atmosphere and barges into the clubroom with her tablet (which obviously doesn't run an early version of Android) announcing how people are praising on messageboards about the game they made at the end of the first series.

We then have a scene with Kirino and Kyousuke at home eating dinner. Kirino is going through all the things she needs to do now that she's home such as go and see her teachers and see the publisher of her book. 

Meanwhile, back at the game-making club, Sena is talking about making a sequel to the game they made because people were talking positively about it. However, due to the fact 90% of the players were male, Sena wants to make it a hardcore yaoi game to appeal to females. The truth is...

PS1 in the background! A big fat grey one I played on too.

A Gamecube, Wii and PS2 as well? Well would you look at that.

After this scene we go back to Kyousuke and Kirino at home and during the night where they both need to go down to get a drink. Kirino is back to her bitchy ways towards Kyousuke. He then asks Kirino about life counselling. The two go back upstairs and we find that Kirino is on her computer with the lights on and is giggling loudly.

Then, just as Kyousuke falls asleep, out of nowhere, Kirino slaps him.

It's just like the first episode of the first series!

It turns out that just like Kyousuke gave her life counselling, Kirino now wants to do the same for Kyousuke. In the only way she knows how...

By taking him to Akihabara.

While in Akiba, Kirino finds that the third series of Meruru has been announced and a PV for it is being shown. She loves it. After that, she goes shopping for all the things she missed while in America and Kyousuke is left to hold all the bags all the way home. I can't help thinking that when I finally get to go to Akiba, I'll act just like Kirino in this scene. Just over Touhou and Vocaloid things rather than eroge.

And when they get home, a huge truck pulls up with more things for Kirino in it.

Those trusty Amaazon.co.jp boxes!

Kirino then gives Kyousuke an eroge to play for helping her while she was out. How sweet.

Then, the episode ends and we hear the new OP theme.

Can't have an OP that isn't by kz for ClariS! It wouldn't be Oreimo otherwise. The song has grown on me, but it can never top irony, the OP to the first series.

Overall, a good solid episode that seems to manage the two endings to the first series well.

-will do episode 2 once I've watched it, can't be bothered now-
