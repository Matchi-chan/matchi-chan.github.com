What I'm playing at the moment.

<!--break-->

It may come as no surprise to people who know me that I would be all over this game, as 3D platformers are my favourite game genre and I'm always on the lookout for more of them to play, but hardly any of them are being made anymore, and when they are, they've been sub-par compared to the greats of the 90s. So when I saw this on Kickstarter, with its claim to revive the genre right and the development being made up of ex-Rare employees who previously worked on Banjo-Kazooie, I was stung. I put down Â£15, enough to get me the game digitally when it came out, because we all know about Kickstarters turning into disasters, especially with physical items. Fast forward to now, it's actually finished and out and I was only reminded I should get my copy by seeing it at retail while I was out. It took forever to download as my internet is beyond shitty right now (thanks BT) plus PSN's tendency to be blazingly slow, and I kept hoping it would be worth the wait. (insert Steam joke here) I was going into it with no knowledge beyond the Kickstarter update emails (which I didn't really read, but it was nice to get them nonetheless), partly intentionally so I could form my own opinions and not listen to your average gaming Youtuber screaming at it for whatever reason or read Gaming Journalism. I'd heard it "doesn't do anything to innovate" but honestly that's fine with me, I want something that sticks to what's tried and true, personally. When it finally finished downloading and I launched it, I was apprehensive. Please don't be shit, I was saying under my breath. The "made with Unity" splash screen appeared and my expectations sunk, however when the game got going I realised I had no reason to be worried. To summarise my thoughts:

Pros:  

* Insanely colourful, well modelled visuals. A joy to look at and it's obvious that effort has been put in.
* Buttery smooth controls, which is what I was worried about. Jumping off ledges is also really responsive. Seriously, the game responds to the controller so well. A bit more awkward when underwater but it always has been since the 90s so I can let it slide.
* Wide variety of collectibles and things to do in the huge levels, encourages exploring and keeping an eye out.
* Comical but sinister story; though I'm not playing it for that.
* Mechanic of expanding levels and having to come back once you get an ability, adding replay value.
* Lots of fourth-wall breaking and other witty one-liners from the characters. Especially the Shovel Knight cameo.

Cons:  

* Lack of expanded camera control: can only press R1 to snap to behind you and the right stick kind of lets you look around but also changes the Y-axis up and down when you turn the stick in that way which can be a pain. A "though the eyes" camera mode would also be useful. Come on, if PS1 games can do this right, so can you.
* Lack of level map. Huge open levels are great and all, but I keep getting the feeling of being lost and overwhelmed once I enter a level.
* I don't know if I'm missing something, but I don't know wtf to do to get to the other levels once I'm in the first one, other than clear out all the collectibles. I'm probably going to have to turn to a walkthrough.
* The grunt voices for the characters start to grate very quickly, though in their defense I can see it makes localisation a matter of text.
