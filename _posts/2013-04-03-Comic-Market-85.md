It's that time again, the second of the two best times of the year. I've compiled my small list of the circles/artists I'm a fan of that are releasing new albums as a checklist. Time to put the 30th of December on my calendar.

Hopefully the uploads will be thick and fast this time. I'm depending on you, China and Perfect Dark.

* [Diverse System] AD:TRANCE 3
* [Diverse System] AD:TRANCE REMIXES
* [ジェリコの法則] Frantic Acceleration
* [ShibayanRecords] RETRO FUTURE GIRLS
* [Rolling Contact] Progressive Starbow 3
* [Rolling Contact] TOUHOU meets HARDCORE 2
* [Amazing Records (DJ Amane)] Party Stream
* [かめるかめりあ] paroxysm
* [999 Recordings (DJ TECHNORCH)] THE BEST OF DJ TECHNORCH 2003-2013
* [マケッツ団] 月の詩 IV - ツキノウタ - 
* [まらしぃ] 幻想遊戯<集>
* [Digital Logics (Alinut)] Blue Paper
* The crap that Alstroemeria is probably putting out because I'm an M and it'll always be one of the first uploaded

I'm most looking forward to Progressive Starbow 3 and Tsuki no Uta 4. And yes, I know that now I've said it those won't appear anywhere. I had to wait nearly a year for Progressive Starbow 2 as it is, and the pain is still there of no GUNFIRE from C82. (Is it still even available on Toranoana and such? I think I'll have to bite with a proxy by now). Diverse System is also on a really good run at the moment as the trance albums are really something, and AD:PIANO2 is coming next M3 according to their website if they can get artists to contribute. And fuck yes new electronic Shibayan, always a treat.

And speaking of doujin music, I wish the guy who uploads from Vocaloid Master would cover Vomas27 already like they said they would. Trying to get releases from other sources is fucking hard, along with the fact there are hardly any without that guy dumping 40+ albums at a time. Y'know with Vocaloid's popularity in Japan and overseas you'd think there'd be more uploads, but only the commercial albums seem to get that treatment. But on the plus side MikuDB seems to be coming back from the ashes of hosting troubles and uploading things again, I'm not a fan of the new site design but beggars can't be choosers. Also I should get around to buying AVTechNO's latest commercial album but I need more money in the bank first as I've dropped a lot on Christmas presents lately. Also that magazine with Kanzaki Hiro drawing Rin-chan on the cover.

It's a good time to be a fan of doujin music, at least for me.
