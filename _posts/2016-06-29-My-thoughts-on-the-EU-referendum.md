Warning: Slightly Salted 

<!--break-->

So you may be aware, the United Kingdom, the country I live in, just voted to leave the European Union, which is exactly what it sounds like, a Union of European countries that look over the continent and make sure it's working well. 

When I first heard of the referendum, I took it like I take every political vote: I look at all sides of the argument unbiased and make my vote decision according to what would be best for me, which you could say is selfish, but if I'm not voting in my own interests then what do I vote based on?

For this referendum, I wasn't really quite sure to begin with, because there wasn't much unbiased information for me to analyse and make my decision with.

However, as the campaigning went on, it became pretty obvious I was going to vote Remain. Let me lay out why.

* UKIP is fucking annoying and who stupid chavs vote for.
* The Leave campaign was fucking annoying.
* The Leave campaign were brushing off every flaw that was pointed out as nothing.
* The Leave campaign were publically racist and xenophobic over immigration.
* The Leave campaign are full of baby boomers completely out of touch with my generation.

Every evening on the news, as I was eating my dinner, I was hearing about those four things. It really got on my nerves, and I reassured myself by knowing that the opinion polls weren't giving in to them and the vote was likely to be Remain. The morning of the vote, I popped down the road and drew a cross in the Remain box.

Then I woke up the morning after, and that's whwere my problems with my country started. It wasn't what the polls had predicted. We left.

It started with Nigel Farage redacting his claim that the £350b we send to the EU every week won't be given to the NHS instead. Which in itself shows just what the Leave campaign is like. They just wanted to push the fact of leaving and didn't actually give a shit about any of their "promises".

Then, something that rather affects me:

Remain: "the economy will go tits up if we leave" <br/>
Leave: "nah mate it won't trust me" <br/>
Markets after the vote: ["Fuck you all"](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-36611512)

The pound being fucked really does affect me: everything is now more expensive. And while it has "stabilised" after the dip, it's far far lower than it was before. This is especially true for most of what I put a lot of money down for: imports from Japan. £1 is now worth ¥137, [when just a week ago it was at ¥160](http://www.xe.com/currencycharts/?from=GBP&to=JPY&view=1W). I don't know how to make a comparison to the old rate but you should be able to understand this is pretty bad.

I think what really annoys me is that I don't think Nigel Farage even understands the deal we had with the EU. We were a special case. We kept the pound, and we literally had it all our own way, we got to pick and choose which EU law applied to us (I think?). If he had such an issue with it, why didn't he push to change the deal instead to fix what he didn't like? How long has he been an MEP? Not to mention his generation have, to my knowledge, had everything in life given to them on a platter: financially stable families, being able to buy a cheap house and sell it on for massive profit, and lots of jobs. So, naturally, he doesn't understand what he's done.

Now, let me get onto my other big problem with this country now: The Leave Voter.

It's been deduced by now that there are distinct kinds of people who voted either way. Leavers are:

* Elderly people who want the good old days back when there weren't as many immigrants.
* Chavs on council estates who are less than intelligent and weren't taking the whole thing seriously, thinking they're rebelling against the government.

Remainers are:

* Young people of my generation.
* Everyone else.

To see that a category that doesn't contain "everyone else" won really says something. My immediate thoughts on waking up after the vote is that there are more people against immigration than I thought, or as I literally thought, "racist and xenophobic fucks", but those same people have now dictated the future of my generation.

Now, while I can't get a job for various reasons and the state pays me to do nothing at my parents' home, something I'm frankly not proud of as I spend my days being depressingly bored and lonely, the affect of leaving is very clear on peoples' livelihoods. Businesses that rely on the EU are now fucked, and a knock on effect is job loss. Nobody wants to lose their job, especially a person of my generation who is renting a tiny flat with many other strangers because they literally can't afford to buy a place to live outright, which is another problem with this country entirely which I won't go into, that means they can't pay their rent and end up in more serious problems raised by inability to pay bills on time. It also means there'll probably be lots of red tape when living and working abroad in the EU. "Nobody's going to enter this country, and nobody's going out!" said the Leave campaign. The other thing I have against Leave voters is they're so judgemental. If you're a Leave voter and reading this, you probably hate me for not voting the same way, right? How DARE you not vote for the right choice, you twat!

Now, I have nothing against the elderly, I think they're precious to society as they've been around longer than everyone else, but I honestly think the Leave campaign was designed in such a way to pander to them. I think in exactly the same way Donald Trump is appealing to the US: pandering to people who are secretly racist and think only "true" people can live there. Obviously, I don't need to explain why this is bad. I think I'm the only person in this country who honestly doesn't mind immigration, I take the view that everyone is equal and can live and work here just as much as anyone else. It's not my business to question why they're here and tell them to "go home". The only issues I do take are the people who come over just to smooch benefits and don't make a living, and if you're going to work you should at least attempt to speak English as that is our official language. To hear that people are being far more openly racist against immigrants after the vote is fucking disgusting and is hardly going to do any good.

What I found rather amusing, in a way, is that London, Scotland, the majority of Wales, and Northern Island voted to Remain. The only thing I like about this disaster is that Scotland is pushing to become independent again and rejoin the EU. If that does happen, I will be very interested in living up there. Also it would be pretty amusing if London broke off and did the same, but it's not like I could ever afford to live there as much as I would love to.

I think I'm just going to have to have a long case of wait and see. I do enjoy living here; I think we're a country with a great history and culture and a great accent, I'd say I'm patriotic. I mean, I own a Mini with a Union Jack on the roof, but that's because they're cute in their own right. 

But it might transpire that I have to move away. And that's why I'm slightly salted over this whole mess. It doesn't quite feel like I'm living in the same country anymore. I want to wake up from this nightmare.

I'm not a politics person, she said, after writing 1369 (Nice) words about it.
