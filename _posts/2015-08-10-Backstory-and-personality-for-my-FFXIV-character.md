So for the past 7 months, I got into a game called Final Fantasy XIV and grew quite attached to my catgirl.

<!--break-->

**Birth name:** Tahla Molkoh </br>
**Age:** 22 </br>
**Race:** Miqo'te, Keeper of the Moon </br>
**Birthplace:** The Sea of Clouds near Moghome, but moved away soon later to the Dravanian Hinterlands around Idyllshire </br>
**Likes:** Dragons, hot chocolate </br>
**Dislikes:** </br>
**Personality traits:** Energetic, self-important, but with a reserved side who prefers to be quiet.

Tahla was born to an ordinary Miqo'te family and grew up pretty peacefully, however she was overshadowed by her brothers, Yabi'a and Thata'to, who aspired to become Scholars. Tahla's parents didn't want her to become an adventurer and instead study theoretical magic in Idyllshire to become a Scholar herself. Tahla didn't like the idea of wasting her life reading magic books and not being able to harness such magic, so when she was 20, and after the Calamity in which Yabi'a died, she ran away to be an adventurer. She travelled for months, and eventually stowed away on a goods carriage. When her journey ended she ended up in Gridania. When she got there, first of all she changed her name as she was starting a new life. She thought Lily was a pretty name, and she chose Leggendaria as a surname because she wanted to be a legendary heroine. She didn't think much of traditional naming conventions and wanted to call herself what she liked. At this time, her parents assumed she'd ran off and then died to a wild beast and were mourning her loss. The next thing Lily did was approach the Lancer's Guild so she could learn to wield a lance like the Dragoons of old she wanted to become. She also chose it because she'd been put off by studying magic from her childhood and wanted a new approach. The guildmaster happily took her in, and she felt a sense of liberation when she held her first lance. Her training continued, and one day as she was strolling around Gridania taking in the countryside, she met Alfie, a fellow Moon Keeper.
