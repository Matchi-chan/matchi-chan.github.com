title: 'How I make my UTAU covers'
---

In case anyone wanted to know, this is a post of the process of making the song covers with UTAU that I post to my [Soundcloud](http://soundcloud.com/matchi-chan).

<!--break-->

First step of my process is deciding what I want to cover with what voicebank. This is usually influenced by what songs I like currently or if I have a .vsq/.ust of a song already downloaded. I also look up on Youtube to see if someone has already done the cover I want to do (and if it's done well enough for me to not want to go and make my own better one)

Then if I don't have one, I go and find if I can download a .vsq/.ust file (and if one doesn't exist I'll look for a midi too, as in the case of my [Ritsu cover of the ED to Kill Me Baby](http://soundcloud.com/matchi-chan/utau-cover-tv-size-namine-1), for a song I want to cover, since I'm part lazy and part don't have the ear to work out the vocal line and do anything by scratch myself.

After that, I take the file(s) into UTAU and render them out into a folder I make for each cover I make. Don't do anything else here since I can't really into UTAU editing yet. (If there are any issues I'll fix them though, as was the case I found when trying to make a Sukone Tei cover of Weekender Girl (which I scrapped because I couldn't get the timings right for the life of me and raged) and found that her 3.1 bank doesn't allow for を sounds, surprisingly. So I had to change them all to お which was quite annoying.))

What I do next is where the magic happens and what skid users of UTAU don't do at all: mixing. For this I use FL Studio. (mostly because I know it's interface and also use it to attempt my failed original music) I open blank Audio Clip channels and load in the output from UTAU along with the song's offvocal. (usually rather bad quality since I often have to get them from Nicosound, I aim to use lossless versions of offvocals if only more of them existed) I then add them all to mixer tracks.

The plugins I use in FL Studio most times are like so in the mixer:
<br/>* Fruity Multiband Compressor
<br/>* Soundgoodizer
<br/>* Fruity Parametric EQ 2
<br/>* (If the song requires it, [like in my most recent cover](http://soundcloud.com/matchi-chan/utau-cover-party-junkie-namine-ritsu)) a plugin like distortion.

For the presets in each I usually cycle through for what sounds best, and in the case of EQ 2 I push the left or right knob where there isn't sound to the end where there is (is that even understandable...) and generally fiddle until I get a nice result.

If I'm having trouble getting the timing right to the offvocal (SO MUCH RAGE AT TIMINGS) I'll import the original song into FL as well to try and help me.

After that's all done, I'll fiddle with volume levels. You generally want the voice to be a bit louder than the background music, but not too much, and vice versa to be able to actually hear the voice over the instrumental like what skids do.

Finally, I'll add a bit of compressor/Soundgoodizer to the master track to try and blend the cover voice into the instrumental and generally give it a final once over.

I then export the finished product to .wav (I can convert down to .mp3 if necessary) and upload it. Or it sits on my hard drive. Either of the two.
