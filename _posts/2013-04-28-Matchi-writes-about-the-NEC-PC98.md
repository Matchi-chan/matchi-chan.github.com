Today, I'm going to write about an old computer series from the 80s/90s which I am very fascinated by, the NEC PC-98 series.

<!--break-->

Because I can. The emulator I am using in the screenshots is the fmgem builds of Neko Project 2 which can be found at [this thread](http://www.shrinemaiden.org/forum/index.php?topic=11117.0) along with instructions to make the Touhou games run well.

Anyway, a basic introduction to this computer for those who don't know: the PC-98 is a series of computers made by NEC (Nippon Electric Company) from 1982 until 2000 and sold only in Japan. Most of the models run MS-DOS in a 16-bit architecture that is similar to the IBM PC but not compatible, and were available as both desktop units and portable laptops. Later in their lifespan they were able to run Windows 95 and 98, official Japanese ports made in partnership with Microsoft. Windows versions 1.0 (yes, I was surprised too) through to 2000 Service Pack 3 were released.

I say that the PC-98 was made until 2000, but they were only popular in the market until the mid-90s. The penultimate model was the PC-9821 which was released in 1992. PC-9821s are the best models specification-wise. They came with CD drives as standard! (I'm not sure about the standard part. Just that some later games came on CD) after PC-98s became less popular in the market, IBM clones came in and NEC succumbed by introducing the PC98-NX line which was basically an IBM clone, not a PC-98 at all.

The very first PC-98s in the 80s had very limited specifications but were good enough for the time, also many computers in the 80s were still 8-bit. The very first model in 1982 only had 128kb of RAM and a CPU running at 8086.5MHz. Only when the PC9901VX came out in 1986 did you finally get a megabyte of RAM, and this model also had an Intel 80286 CPU running at 10MHz, PC-98s had Intel CPUs from this model on, and a few of the earlier ones had in-house NEC-made CPUs. The resolution a lot of models ran graphical programs at was 640x400 which was impressive for the time, 640x480 was also possible.

It is interesting to note that while a "NEC PC-98" was not sold in any Western countries, the NEC APC III was which is of the same time period and is likely to be it's own thing or taken from the PC88/98. Further reading about the APC can be found [here](http://www.atarimagazines.com/creative/v11n2/60_NEC_APCIII_NECs_PC_with.php).

For storage media, the PC-98 used floppy discs and IDE hard drives. Most of the models had an internal floppy drive, there were both 5.25inch and 3.5inch drives available. This is also how most software was distributed. I think the only thing that would appear when you booted one was the BIOS and MS-DOS if it was installed on the hard drive.

I found what looks like the program that asks you what drive to boot and I don't even know how. (From what I can translate, the very top line says "NEC Personal Computer something something Disk something something Menu Program Version 2.10) and as you can see, I can select and run MS-DOS 3.30. Though, pressing enter boots Mystic Square which is the hard drive image I left in the emulator. The executable I'm running here is np21nt.exe, which is the version of NP2 which emulates the PC-9821 on the Windows NT kernel. 

Now, the reason the PC-98 was so popular and absolutely dominated Japan's PC market, at least in the 80s, was the fact it did the most essential thing extremely well: it had the best support and display for Japanese characters out of the models on the market at that time. (the main rivals were the Sharp X68000 and Fujitsu FM Towns, also neither of these ran MS-DOS, I believe) It was built into the bane of the system, so obviously, Japanese consumers were more inclined to buy into it.

One of the things about the PC-98, and how most people know of them, is that despite being designed as a computer for business, it had a ton of game titles (didn't that happen with *every* computer released in the 80s/90s?) and what's interesting is an awful lot of these titles were doujin software, independently sold software by hobbyists. (Think indie games as they are today, just without Comiket and other events to sell them at, and you're there.) The fact you need just make a ton of floppy discs with your game on it that you made to run under DOS made it easy to distribute games and software. The user just needs to insert the floppy into the drive and install/run the program. I imagine most of these games also ran on Windows 95/98 in theory but I have not seen that this is possible. DosBox also has been asked about PC-98 support but as the emulators out there are perfectly fine I see this as unneeded. (Shame that emulation is only perfect on Windows and the Mac version of NP2 is PowerPC.)

What initially made me aware of the PC-98, and is something I hold very dear to my heart, is that the first 5 Touhou games were made for it. As you will know if you're a friend of mine or follow me on Twitter is that I love my Touhous, and if you ask me what my favourite game in the series is, I'll say Mystic Square which was the last game made for the 98 and known as one of the best of the 5 PC-98 games that ZUN made. Despite having to pirate these games because of their rarity and the fact I don't have a PC-98 machine, I've ended up playing these games an awful lot and I've grown to love them so much. I haven't played a Windows Touhou in ages.

This brings me onto another thing about the PC-98: the amazing sound chips. These chips use 8-channel FM synthesis, and the sounds they produce are absolutely brilliant (to me, anyway). This beauty is (in my opinion), best experienced with the music for the Touhou games, which as with the entire series, the music is one of the best parts of the games. [Here's an example from the MS soundtrack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQaWZ_X3tCY).  If I get the chance I would love to make original music with FM, however writing MML is just too much for me to deal with. To make music on the PC-98 you write MML, then compile it with a specific program into a .M file.

There are of course, many other games for this computer of varying genres, just I know the most about Touhou. There are a lot of games (including lots of eroge) with amazing pixel art for the time, this pixel art used a lot of dithering to make the most of the limited colour palette. Some of the eroge companies around nowadays started on the PC-98. The colour palette is the reason why Reimu had purple hair in the first 5 games and a lot of other characters were blonde on purple.

Since I made this post originally, I've found out a lot of things, like the fact that a port of FreeBSD has existed for the architecture since 1994, the partition map used by the FORMAT program is NEC proprietary (as are a lot of things in the architecture are, I'm guessing) and that quite a few popular Western games were ported and translated for it, including SimCity, Doom and Doom2, Wolfenstein, Lode Runner and Prince of Persia. (I can't get Doom to boot in NP21, I'm highly annoyed.)

Also, a full set of the 5 Touhou games on floppy, in sealed condition being sold in Mandarake for 525,000 yen. I know, I can't hold back my tears at that price.

Well, I can't think of anything more to say so I guess I'll end this blog post. This is probably full of misinformation and shitty explanations but I hate myself. I'm going to bed after I commit this to git
