Today, I'm going to write about an old computer series from the 80s/90s which I am very fascinated by, the NEC PC98.

<!--break-->

Because I can. The emulator I am using in the screenshots is the fmgem builds of Neko Project 2 which can be found at [this thread](http://www.shrinemaiden.org/forum/index.php?topic=11117.0) along with instructions to make the Touhou games run well.

Anyway, a basic introduction to this computer for those who don't know: the PC98 is a series of computers made by NEC (Nippon Electric Company) from 1982 until 2000 and sold only in Japan. Most of the models run MS-DOS in a 16-bit environment and were available as both desktop units and portable laptops. Later in their lifespan they were able to run Windows 95 and probably 98. (I do have a disc image from MSDN of Win2000 for it though!)

I say that the PC98 was made until 2000, but they were only popular in the market until the mid-90s. The penultimate model was the PC9821 which was released in 1992, then a model came out of nowhere (and I assume, flopped) in 2000.

The very first PC98s in the 80s had very limited specifications but were good enough for the time, also many computers in the 80s were still 8-bit. The very first model in 1982 only had 128kb of RAM and a CPU running at 8086.5MHz. Only when the PC9901VX came out in 1986 did you finally get a megabyte of RAM, and this model also had an Intel 80286 CPU running at 10MHz, PC98s had Intel CPUs from this model on, and a few of the earlier ones had in-house NEC-made CPUs. The resolution a lot of models ran graphical programs at was 640x400 which was impressive for the time.

It is interesting to note that while a "NEC PC98" was not sold in any Western countries, the NEC APC III was which is similar inside to early models but different. I'm curious as to how compatible with PC98 software it is, if it is. Further reading about the APC can be found [here](http://www.atarimagazines.com/creative/v11n2/60_NEC_APCIII_NECs_PC_with.php).

For storage media, the PC98 used floppy discs and most of the models had an internal floppy drive. This is also how most software was distributed. I think the only thing that would appear when you booted one was the BIOS and MS-DOS which I should think would have been in ROM.

I found what looks like the BIOS and I don't even know how. (From what I can translate, the very top line says "NEC Personal Computer something something Disk something something Menu Program Version 2.10) and as you can see, I can select and run MS-DOS 3.30. Though, pressing enter boots Mystic Square which is the game image I left in the emulator. The executable I'm running here is np21nt.exe, which is the version of NP2 which emulates the PC9821 on the Windows NT kernel. For obvious reasons, the first Touhou game does not run well on this executable.

Now, the reason the PC98 was so popular and absolutely dominated Japan's PC market, at least in the 80s, was the fact it did the most essential thing extremely well: it had the best support and display for Japanese characters out of the models on the market at that time. (the main rivals were the Sharp X68000 and Fujitsu FM Towns, also neither of these ran MS-DOS, I believe) It was built into the bane of the system, so obviously, Japanese consumers were more inclined to buy into it.

One of the things about the PC98, and how most people know of them, is that despite being designed as a computer for business, it had a ton of game titles (didn't that happen with *every* computer released in the 80s/90s?) and what's interesting is an awful lot of these titles were doujin software, independently sold software by hobbyists. (Think indie games as they are today, just without Comiket and other events to sell them at, and you're there.) The fact you need just make a ton of floppy discs with your game on it that you made in MS-DOS made it easy to distribute games and software. The user just needs to insert the floppy into the drive and install/run the program. I imagine most of these games also ran on Windows 95/98 in theory but I have not seen that this is possible. DosBox also has been asked about PC98 support but as the emulators out there are perfectly fine I see this as unneeded. (Shame that emulation is only perfect on Windows and the Mac version of NP2 is PowerPC.)

What initially made me aware of the PC98, and is something I hold very dear to my heart, is that the first 5 Touhou games were made for it. As you will know if you're a friend of mine or follow me on Twitter is that I love my Touhous, and if you ask me what my favourite game in the series is, I'll say Mystic Square which was the last game made for the 98 and known as one of the best of the 5 PC98 games that ZUN made. Despite having to pirate these games because of their rarity and the fact I don't have a PC98 machine, I've ended up playing these games an awful lot and I've grown to love them so much.

This brings me onto another thing about the PC98: the amazing sound chips. These chips use 8-channel FM synthesis, and the sounds they produce are absolutely brilliant (to me, anyway). This beauty is (in my opinion), best experienced with the music for the Touhou games, which as with the entire series, the music is one of the best parts of the game. [Here's an example from the MS soundtrack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQaWZ_X3tCY).  If I get the chance I would love to make original music with these chips. (It's a shame that soundfont I found isn't being distributedâ€¦)

There are of course, many other games for this computer of varying genres, just I know the most about Touhou. There are a lot of games (including lots of eroge) with amazing pixel art for the time, this pixel art used a lot of dithering to make the most of the limited colour palette. (Which is the reason why Reimu had purple hair in the first 5 games and a lot of other characters were blonde on purple.)

Well, I can't think of anything more to say so I guess I'll end this blog post.
