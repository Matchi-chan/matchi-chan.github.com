-Get Japanese CV out of the way and sounding good
-Japanese VCV after that?

-Appends?
--Whisper/soft
--Chibi/loli
--My voice is not good enough for Kire and definitely not Kire VCV
--Make my normal deep-ish voice into an append? 
--Japanese syllables over-accentuating my British accent as a joke and lols
--All above will probably be CV

-Basic full English voicebank
-Improve it? CVVC? (don't do CVVC)

-Distribution
--zip format like every other good voicebank
--Hiragana filenames with romaji aliases
--Romaji filenames with hiragana aliases for the stupid fucks who can't into Japanese locale

-How bad will I be at oto'ing

I have no interest in doing any other languages

Do I pirate a good music editing program for fine tuning samples
