[21:24:08] Matchi-chan: FUCKING PINGU
[21:24:10] Matchi-chan: FOR PS1
[21:25:31] RichardR: WHAT
[21:25:36] RichardR: I DID NOT KNOW ABOUT THIS
[21:27:07] Matchi-chan: SAME
[21:27:15] Matchi-chan: I DIDN'T KNOW THERE WAS A PINGU GAME
[21:27:21] Matchi-chan: I'D HAVE LOVED THIS WHEN I WAS LITTLE
[21:27:25] RichardR: I KNEW OF PC GAMES
[21:27:40] Matchi-chan: LET ALONE A JAPANESE ONE AND LIMITED EDITION TOO
[21:28:13] Matchi-chan: Pingu must be ultra-popular in Japan, I wonder what country it was actually made in.
[21:28:27] RichardR: Right here.
[21:28:31] RichardR: It was BBC.
[21:28:54] Matchi-chan: Well that's the existence of BBC Japan right there if it exists.
[21:29:07] RichardR: Oh wait.
[21:29:19] RichardR: Switzerland for the first few seasons.
[21:29:24] RichardR: In partnership with the BBC.
[21:29:38] Matchi-chan: Ah that makes sense.
[21:29:48] Matchi-chan: But the BBC held all rights I assume?
[21:29:48] RichardR: So BBC kind of contracted it out.
[21:30:01] RichardR: Well HiT Entertainment seem to now.
[21:30:16] RichardR: They own Thomas the Swag Engine, Bob the Builder and I think Postman Tap.
[21:30:31] Matchi-chan: And they shitted it up with the new shitty Pingu opening sequences ;~;
